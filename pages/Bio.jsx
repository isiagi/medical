              As much as biological agents and their toxins can be used in
              research for the advancement of science, there is a great
              potential for their mis-use as well to pose a threat to public
              health and safety, agriculture or the environment. Global events
              in the recent past have highlighted the need to protect
              laboratories / containment facilities and the materials they
              contain from being intentionally compromised in ways that may harm
              people, livestock, agriculture or the environment. At Hitex
              consortium we recognize the dual use nature of these biological
              agents. Through our highly skilled team, we conduct Biosecurity
              risk assessment for our customers to help them identify the
              potential threats with their systems and help them build strong
              mitigations measures that prevent theft, mis‚Äêuse or intentional
              release of these organisms and their toxins. <br />
              Our teams work with our customers specifically to build well
              embedded biosecurity systems right from ensuring the integrity of
              the staff working with this biological agents to ensuring systems
              are set up for proper accountability of these agents as well
              setting up systems to detect and deter any biosecurity threats.
