            As much as biological agents and their toxins can be used in
            research for the advancement of science, there is a great potential
            for their mis-use as well to pose a threat to public health and
            safety, agriculture or the environment. Global events in the recent
            past have highlighted the need to protect laboratories / containment
            facilities and the materials they contain from being intentionally
            compromised in ways that may harm people, livestock, agriculture or
            the environment. At Hitex consortium we recognize the dual use
            nature of these biological agents. Through our highly skilled team,
            we conduct Biosecurity risk assessment for our customers to help
            them identify the potential threats with their systems and help them
            build strong mitigations measures that prevent theft, mis‚Äêuse or
            intentional release of these organisms and their toxins. <br />
            Our teams work with our customers specifically to build well
            embedded biosecurity systems right from ensuring the integrity of
            the staff working with this biological agents to ensuring systems
            are set up for proper accountability of these agents as well setting
            up systems to detect and deter any biosecurity threats.
